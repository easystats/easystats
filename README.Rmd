## What is *easystats*?

**easystats** is a collection of R packages, which aims to provide a unifying
and consistent framework to tame, discipline, and harness the scary R statistics
and their pesky models.

However, there is not (yet) an *unique* "easystats" way of doing data
analysis. Instead, start with one package and, when you'll face a new
challenge, do check if there is an _easystats_ answer for it in other packages.
You will slowly uncover how using them together facilitates your life. And, who
knows, you might even end up using them all. ***Gotta catch 'em all!*** <!--
'tis a pokémon reference for y'all grandpas -->

## Getting started

Each **easystats** package has a different scope and purpose. This means your
**best way to start** is to explore and pick the one(s) that you feel might be
useful to you. However, as they are built with a "bigger picture" in mind, you
will realize that using more of them creates a smooth workflow, as these
packages are meant to work together. Ideally, these packages work in unison to
cover all aspects of statistical analysis and data visualization.

- [**report**](https://github.com/easystats/report): 📜 🎉 Automated statistical
  reporting of objects in R
- [**correlation**](https://github.com/easystats/correlation): 🔗 Your all-in-one
  package to run correlations
- [**modelbased**](https://github.com/easystats/modelbased): 📈 Estimate effects,
  group averages and contrasts between groups based on statistical models
- [**bayestestR**](https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR): 👻 Great for
  beginners or experts of Bayesian statistics
- [**parameters**](https://github.com/easystats/parameters): 📊 Obtain a table
  containing all information about the parameters of your models
- [**performance**](https://github.com/easystats/performance): 💪 Models' quality
  and performance metrics (R2, ICC, LOO, AIC, BF, ...)
- [**effectsize**](https://github.com/easystats/effectsize): 🐉 Compute, convert,
  interpret and work with indices of effect size and standardized parameters
- [**insight**](https://github.com/easystats/insight): 🔮 For developers, a
  package to help you work with different models and packages
- [**see**](https://github.com/easystats/see): 🎨 The plotting companion to
  create beautiful results visualizations

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is *easystats* different from the *tidyverse*?**

You've probably already heard about the
[**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), another very popular collection of
packages (*ggplot*, *dplyr*, *tidyr*, ...) that also makes using R easier. So,
should you pick the *tidyverse* or *easystats*? **Pick both!** 

Indeed, these two ecosystems have been designed with very different goals in
mind. The *tidyverse* packages are primarily made to create a new R experience,
where data manipulation and exploration is intuitive and consistent. On the
other hand, **easystats** focuses more on the final stretch of the analysis:
understanding and interpreting your results and reporting them in a manuscript
or a report, while following best practices. You can definitely use the
*easystats* functions in a *tidyverse* workflow!

**easystats + tidyverse =** ❤️

**Can *easystats* be useful to advanced users and/or developers?**

Yes, definitely! **easystats** is built in terms of modules that are general
enough to be used inside other packages. For instance, the *insight* package is
made to easily implement support for post-processing of pretty much all
regression model packages under the sun. We use it in all the *easystats*
packages, but it also used for instance in
[**ggstatsplot**](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot),
[**ggeffects**](https://github.com/strengejacke/ggeffects), and more. 

**So why not in yours**? 

Moreover, the *easystats* packages are very lightweight, with a minimal set of
dependencies, which again makes it great if you want to rely on them.

## Installation

The whole `easystats` suite can be installed *at once* with the following:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("easystats/easystats")
```

You can then load the entire ecosystem by running:

```r
library("easystats")
```

## Documentation

### Websites

Each `easystats` package has a dedicated website.

For example, website for `parameters` is
<https://easystats.github.io/parameters/>.

### Blog

In addition to the websites containing documentation for these packages, you can
also read posts from `easystats` blog:
<https://easystats.github.io/blog/posts/>.

<!-- ### Other learning resources -->

<!-- In addition to these websites and blog posts, you can also check out the -->
<!-- following presentations and talks to learn more about this ecosystem: -->

<!-- TODO: https://github.com/easystats/easystats/issues/103 -->

## Dependencies

Most *easystats* packages are very lightweight, *i.e.*, they don't rely nor
import any other packages! This means that you can safely use them as
dependencies in your own packages, without the risk of a butterfly effect, where
a small change in a distant downstream dependency with unexpected upstream
consequences.

For example, the `parameters` package only relies on two other packages.

```{r depnetwork_parameters, echo=FALSE}
library(deepdep)
plot_dependencies("parameters", depth = 3)
```

<!-- TODO: uncomment once on CRAN -->

<!-- ```{r depnetwork_easystats} -->
<!-- library(deepdep) -->
<!-- plot_dependencies("easystats", depth = 3) -->
<!-- ``` -->

**There is one exception**!

The [**see**](http://easystats.github.io/see) package is
one of our high-level packages that is responsible for plotting and creating
figures, relying thus on other packages such as *ggplot2*, which has a substantial number of dependencies.

```{r depnetwork_see, echo=FALSE}
library(deepdep)
plot_dependencies("see", depth = 3)
```

## Citation

How to reference *easystats*?

1. **Cite specific packages**

The most parsimonious approach is to cite only the particular package that
helped you, e.g., 

> "using *bayestestR* (Makowski, Ben-Shachar, & Lüdecke, 2019)".

2. **Cite the whole ecosystem** :heart:

Want to credit the whole *easystats* ecosystem of packages? 

This can be done with a sentence like the following:

> Data processing was carried out with R (R Core Team, 2019) and the *easystats*

## Versioning

Package version numbers indicate following: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.DEVELOPMENT`. 
Here are key steps to keep in mind:

- As long as packages are in a more or less rapidly developing and changing
state, the **major** version number is typically `0`.

- Once we think we will have a stable base that will likely not change
dramatically or soon, the major version number will be set to `1`, and will be
increased for following major changes that probably break the current API.

- When new features are added or (re)moved, we typically increase the **minor**
version number.

- Minimal changes or bug fixes only are indicated by increasing the **patch**
version number.

Current development versions of our packages (i.e. master/main branch from
GitHub) additionally have a **development** version number.
