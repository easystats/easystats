# What is *easystats*?

**easystats** is a collection of R packages, which aims to provide a unifying
and consistent framework to tame, discipline, and harness the scary R statistics
and their pesky models.

However, there is not (yet) an *unique* "easystats" way of doing data
analysis. Instead, start with one package and, when you'll face a new
challenge, do check if there is an _easystats_ answer for it in other packages.
You will slowly uncover how using them together facilitates your life. And, who
knows, you might even end up using them all. ***Gotta catch 'em all!*** <!--
'tis a pok√©mon reference for y'all grandpas -->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/logo_wall.png")
```

# Installation

The whole `easystats` suite can be installed *at once* with the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("easystats", repos = "https://easystats.r-universe.dev")
```

You can then load the entire ecosystem by running:

```{r}
library("easystats")
```

The package is currently not available on CRAN, but we are working on submitting
it there soon.

# Getting started

Each **easystats** package has a different scope and purpose. This means your
**best way to start** is to explore and pick the one(s) that you feel might be
useful to you. However, as they are built with a "bigger picture" in mind, you
will realize that using more of them creates a smooth workflow, as these
packages are meant to work together. Ideally, these packages work in unison to
cover all aspects of statistical analysis and data visualization.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**How is *easystats* different from the *tidyverse*?**

You've probably already heard about the
[**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), another very popular collection of
packages (*ggplot*, *dplyr*, *tidyr*, ...) that also makes using R easier. So,
should you pick the *tidyverse* or *easystats*? **Pick both!** 

Indeed, these two ecosystems have been designed with very different goals in
mind. The *tidyverse* packages are primarily made to create a new R experience,
where data manipulation and exploration is intuitive and consistent. On the
other hand, **easystats** focuses more on the final stretch of the analysis:
understanding and interpreting your results and reporting them in a manuscript
or a report, while following best practices. You can definitely use the
*easystats* functions in a *tidyverse* workflow!

> **easystats + tidyverse =** ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Can *easystats* be useful to advanced users and/or developers?**

Yes, definitely! **easystats** is built in terms of modules that are general
enough to be used inside other packages. For instance, the *insight* package is
made to easily implement support for post-processing of pretty much all
regression model packages under the sun. We use it in all the *easystats*
packages, but it is also used in other non-easystats packages, such as 
[**ggstatsplot**](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot),  [**modelsummary**](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary/), 
[**ggeffects**](https://github.com/strengejacke/ggeffects), and more. 

**So why not in yours**? 

Moreover, the *easystats* packages are very lightweight, with a minimal set of
dependencies, which again makes it great if you want to rely on them.

# Documentation

## Websites

Each `easystats` package has a dedicated website.

For example, website for `parameters` is
<https://easystats.github.io/parameters/>.

## Blog

In addition to the websites containing documentation for these packages, you can
also read posts from `easystats` blog:
<https://easystats.github.io/blog/posts/>.

## Other learning resources

In addition to these websites and blog posts, you can also check out the
following presentations and talks to learn more about this ecosystem:

<https://easystats.github.io/easystats/articles/resources.html>

# Dependencies

Most *easystats* packages are very lightweight, *i.e.*, they don't rely nor
import any other packages! This means that you can safely use them as
dependencies in your own packages, without the risk of a butterfly effect, where
a small change in a distant downstream dependency with unexpected upstream
consequences.

For example, the `parameters` package only relies on two other packages.

```{r depnetwork_parameters, echo=FALSE}
library(deepdep)
plot_dependencies("parameters", depth = 3)
```

<!-- TODO: uncomment once on CRAN -->

<!-- ```{r depnetwork_easystats} -->
<!-- library(deepdep) -->
<!-- plot_dependencies("easystats", depth = 3) -->
<!-- ``` -->

**There is one exception**!

The [**see**](http://easystats.github.io/see) package is
one of our high-level packages that is responsible for plotting and creating
figures, relying thus on other packages such as *ggplot2*, which has a substantial number of dependencies.

```{r depnetwork_see, echo=FALSE}
library(deepdep)
plot_dependencies("see", depth = 3)
```

# Versioning

Package version numbers indicate following: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.DEVELOPMENT`. 
Here are key steps to keep in mind:

- As long as packages are in a more or less rapidly developing and changing
state, the **major** version number is typically `0`.

- Once we think we will have a stable base that will likely not change
dramatically or soon, the major version number will be set to `1`, and will be
increased for following major changes that probably break the current API.

- When new features are added or (re)moved, we typically increase the **minor**
version number.

- Minimal changes or bug fixes only are indicated by increasing the **patch**
version number.

- Current development versions of our packages (i.e. master/main branch from
GitHub) additionally have a **development** version number.

# Contributing

We are happy to receive bug reports, suggestions, questions, and (most of all)
contributions to fix problems and add features. Pull Requests for contributions are encouraged.

Here are some simple ways in which you can contribute (in the increasing order
of commitment):

  - Read and correct any inconsistencies in the documentation
  - Raise issues about bugs or wanted features
  - Review code
  - Add new functionality
