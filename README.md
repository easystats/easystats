# What is *easystats*?

**easystats** is a collection of R packages, which aims to provide a
unifying and consistent framework to tame, discipline, and harness the
scary R statistics and their pesky models.

However, there is not (yet) an *unique* ‚Äúeasystats‚Äù way of doing data
analysis. Instead, start with one package and, when you‚Äôll face a new
challenge, do check if there is an *easystats* answer for it in other
packages. You will slowly uncover how using them together facilitates
your life. And, who knows, you might even end up using them all.
***Gotta catch ‚Äôem all\!*** <!--
'tis a pok√©mon reference for y'all grandpas -->

# Getting started

Each **easystats** package has a different scope and purpose. This means
your **best way to start** is to explore and pick the one(s) that you
feel might be useful to you. However, as they are built with a ‚Äúbigger
picture‚Äù in mind, you will realize that using more of them creates a
smooth workflow, as these packages are meant to work together. Ideally,
these packages work in unison to cover all aspects of statistical
analysis and data visualization.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**How is *easystats* different from the *tidyverse*?**

You‚Äôve probably already heard about the
[**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), another very popular
collection of packages (*ggplot*, *dplyr*, *tidyr*, ‚Ä¶) that also makes
using R easier. So, should you pick the *tidyverse* or *easystats*?
**Pick both\!**

Indeed, these two ecosystems have been designed with very different
goals in mind. The *tidyverse* packages are primarily made to create a
new R experience, where data manipulation and exploration is intuitive
and consistent. On the other hand, **easystats** focuses more on the
final stretch of the analysis: understanding and interpreting your
results and reporting them in a manuscript or a report, while following
best practices. You can definitely use the *easystats* functions in a
*tidyverse* workflow\!

> **easystats + tidyverse =** ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Can *easystats* be useful to advanced users and/or developers?**

Yes, definitely\! **easystats** is built in terms of modules that are
general enough to be used inside other packages. For instance, the
*insight* package is made to easily implement support for
post-processing of pretty much all regression model packages under the
sun. We use it in all the *easystats* packages, but it is also used in
other non-easystats packages, such as
[**ggstatsplot**](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot),
[**modelsummary**](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary/),
[**ggeffects**](https://github.com/strengejacke/ggeffects), and more.

**So why not in yours**?

Moreover, the *easystats* packages are very lightweight, with a minimal
set of dependencies, which again makes it great if you want to rely on
them.

# Installation

The whole `easystats` suite can be installed *at once* with the
following:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("easystats/easystats")
```

You can then load the entire ecosystem by running:

``` r
library("easystats")
```

# Documentation

## Websites

Each `easystats` package has a dedicated website.

For example, website for `parameters` is
<https://easystats.github.io/parameters/>.

## Blog

In addition to the websites containing documentation for these packages,
you can also read posts from `easystats` blog:
<https://easystats.github.io/blog/posts/>.

## Other learning resources

In addition to these websites and blog posts, you can also check out the
following presentations and talks to learn more about this ecosystem:

<https://easystats.github.io/easystats/articles/resources.html>

# Dependencies

Most *easystats* packages are very lightweight, *i.e.*, they don‚Äôt rely
nor import any other packages\! This means that you can safely use them
as dependencies in your own packages, without the risk of a butterfly
effect, where a small change in a distant downstream dependency with
unexpected upstream consequences.

For example, the `parameters` package only relies on two other packages.

![](man/figures/depnetwork_parameters-1.png)<!-- -->

<!-- TODO: uncomment once on CRAN -->

<!-- ```{r depnetwork_easystats} -->

<!-- library(deepdep) -->

<!-- plot_dependencies("easystats", depth = 3) -->

<!-- ``` -->

**There is one exception**\!

The [**see**](http://easystats.github.io/see) package is one of our
high-level packages that is responsible for plotting and creating
figures, relying thus on other packages such as *ggplot2*, which has a
substantial number of dependencies.

# Citation

How to reference *easystats*?

1.  **Cite specific packages**

The most parsimonious approach is to cite only the particular package
that helped you, e.g.,

> ‚Äúusing *bayestestR* (Makowski, Ben-Shachar, & L√ºdecke, 2019)‚Äù.

2.  **Cite the whole ecosystem** :heart:

Want to credit the whole *easystats* ecosystem of packages?

This can be done with a sentence like the following:

> Data processing was carried out with R (R Core Team, 2019) and the
> *easystats* ecosystem (L√ºdecke, Waggoner, & Makowski, 2019; L√ºdecke,

# Versioning

Package version numbers indicate following:
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.DEVELOPMENT`. Here are key steps to keep in mind:

  - As long as packages are in a more or less rapidly developing and
    changing state, the **major** version number is typically `0`.

  - Once we think we will have a stable base that will likely not change
    dramatically or soon, the major version number will be set to `1`,
    and will be increased for following major changes that probably
    break the current API.

  - When new features are added or (re)moved, we typically increase the
    **minor** version number.

  - Minimal changes or bug fixes only are indicated by increasing the
    **patch** version number.

  - Current development versions of our packages (i.e.¬†master/main
    branch from GitHub) additionally have a **development** version
    number.
