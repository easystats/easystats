## What is *easystats*?

*easystats* is a collection of R packages, which aims to provide a
unifying and consistent framework to tame, discipline, and harness the
scary R statistics and their pesky models.

However, there is not (yet) an *unique* ‚Äúeasystats‚Äù way of doing data
analysis. Instead, start with one package and, when you‚Äôll face a new
challenge, do check if there is an *easystats* answer for it in other
packages. You will slowly uncover how using them together facilitates
your life. And, who knows, you might even end up using them all.

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/easystats/easystats/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/easystats/easystats/actions)

| Type | Source | Command |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Release | CRAN | `install.packages("easystats")` |
| Development | r-universe | `install.packages("easystats", repos = "https://easystats.r-universe.dev")` |
| Development | GitHub | `remotes::install_github("easystats/easystats")` |

Finally, as *easystats* sometimes depends on some additional packages
for specific functions that are not downloaded by default. If you want
to benefit from the **full *easystats* experience** without any hiccups,
simply run the following:

``` r
easystats::install_suggested()
```

## Citation

To cite the package, run the following command:

## Getting started

Each *easystats* package has a different scope and purpose. This means
your **best way to start** is to explore and pick the one(s) that you
feel might be useful to you. However, as they are built with a ‚Äúbigger
picture‚Äù in mind, you will realize that using more of them creates a
smooth workflow, as these packages are meant to work together. Ideally,
these packages work in unison to cover all aspects of statistical
analysis and data visualization.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is *easystats* different from the *tidyverse*?**

You‚Äôve probably already heard about the
[**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), another very popular
collection of packages (*ggplot*, *dplyr*, *tidyr*, ‚Ä¶) that also makes
using R easier. So, should you pick the *tidyverse* or *easystats*?
**Pick both!**

Indeed, these two ecosystems have been designed with very different
goals in mind. The *tidyverse* packages are primarily made to create a
new R experience, where data manipulation and exploration is intuitive
and consistent. On the other hand, **easystats** focuses more on the
final stretch of the analysis: understanding and interpreting your
results and reporting them in a manuscript or a report, while following
best practices. You can definitely use the *easystats* functions in a
*tidyverse* workflow!

> **easystats + tidyverse =** ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Can *easystats* be useful to advanced users and/or developers?**

Yes, definitely! **easystats** is built in terms of modules that are
general enough to be used inside other packages. For instance, the
*insight* package is made to easily implement support for
post-processing of pretty much all regression model packages under the
sun. We use it in all the *easystats* packages, but it is also used in
other non-easystats packages, such as
[**ggstatsplot**](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot),
[**modelsummary**](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary/),
[**ggeffects**](https://github.com/strengejacke/ggeffects), and more.

**So why not in yours**?

Moreover, the *easystats* packages are very lightweight, with a minimal
set of dependencies, which again makes it great if you want to rely on
them.

## Documentation

### Websites

Each `easystats` package has a dedicated website.

For example, website for `parameters` is
<https://easystats.github.io/parameters/>.

### Blog

In addition to the websites containing documentation for these packages,
you can also read posts from `easystats` blog:
<https://easystats.github.io/blog/posts/>.

### Other learning resources

In addition to these websites and blog posts, you can also check out the
following presentations and talks to learn more about this ecosystem:

<https://easystats.github.io/easystats/articles/resources.html>

## Dependencies

*easystats* packages are designed to be lightweight, *i.e.*, they don‚Äôt
have any third-party hard dependencies, other than base-R packages or
other *easystats* packages! If you develop R packages, this means that
you can safely use *easystats* packages as dependencies in your own
packages, without the risk of entering the [dependency
hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

``` r
library(deepdep)

plot_dependencies("easystats", depth = 2, show_stamp = FALSE)
```

<img src="man/figures/depnetwork-1.png" width="100%" />

As we can see, the only exception is the
[`{see}`](https://easystats.github.io/see/) package, which is
responsible for plotting and creating figures and relies on `{ggplot2}`,
which does have a substantial number of dependencies.
