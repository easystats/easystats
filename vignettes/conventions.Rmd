Following conventions apply to the easystats-ecosystem, to ensure that function
and argument names as well as element names for return-values follow a
consistent pattern across all packages.

**Importing other packages**

  - No full import, only selective import of functions

  - Use base-R wherever possible (to reduce hard dependencies)

  - Make sure R-version requirements are not too strict

**Package versioning**

  - Package versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) conventions.

**Helper-functions**

  - Own re-implementation of helper-functions, if it's not too much effort (e.g.
    I typically use own functions to check if a string starts / ends with a
    pattern, or if an object (list, data frame) contains an element with a given
    name (like `tibble::has_name()`), to reduce dependencies.

**`print` functions**

- `print` methods should invisibly return the original (unchanged) input ([#65](https://github.com/easystats/easystats/issues/65)).

**Function names**

  - Lower case, underscore separated if more than one verb.
  
  - Common prefix for functions that focus on specific "tasks" or workflows
    (e.g. **insight**, `get_*()` to get data, `find_*()` to find information, or
    **performance**, `performance_*()` to compute measures of model quality,
    `check_*()` to check model assumptions...).
    
  - Internal functions (that are not exported, like the previously mentioned
    helper-functions) should always start with a `.` (e.g.,
    `.do_some_internal_stuff()`).

**Argument names**

- lower case, underscore separated if more than one verb

**Element / Column names** (for returned data frames)

1)  First letter of the column name is capital, unless (6) applies (*example:*
    `Parameter`).
    
2)  First letter of nouns is capital, unless (6) applies (*example:*
    `ROPE_Percentage`, `Prior_Scale`).
    
3)  Using underscore rather than camelCase to separate words (*example:*
    `CI_high`).
    
4)  Multiple words: common/main part first and adjective/specifier/variational
    part after, unless (8) applies (*example:* `Median_standardized`,
    `ROPE_percentage`).
    
5)  Abbreviations: all uppercase (*example:* `ESS`, `MCSE`, `ROPE`).

6)  Keep conventions for reserved words (*example:* `p`, `pd`, `Rhat`).

7)  Adjectives / verbs: all lower case, unless (1) applies (*example:* `high` or
    `low` in `CI_high` or `CI_low`).
    
8)  In case of multiple occurrences of column names that indicate the same
    measure or content (like `CI_low` or `SE`), the common part is appended as
    suffix to the context specific part (*example:* `CI_low` and
    `Eta2_partial_CI_low`, and **not** `CI_low` and `CI_low_Eta2_partial`).
    
9)  The "squared" term in column names that refers to "common" statistics
    (`Eta2`, `Chi2`, `Omega2`, ...) should be written as `2`, not `sq`,
    `squared` or `p√©tit-deux` (*example:* `Chi2`, and **not** `Chisq`, `Eta2`,
    and **not** `Eta_squared`). This rule does **not** apply to function names.
