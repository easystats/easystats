# R Programming

Programming in R is actually quite simple, yet powerful compared to other languages like Python or such. Part of this power comes from the flexibility of how R works.

Hopefully, by the end of this short crash-course, you'll have enough understanding of R programming to be able to understand how packages are made and then, contribute.

## Basic Elements

### Assigning and Commenting

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x <- rnorm(n=1)  # Generate n=1 random number
x  # Display it
```

Note here that we generated a random number between 0 and 1 using the `rnorm()` **function** (specifying that we want only one number using the `n` **argument**), that we **stored** it inside a **variable** called `x` (using the **assignment** operator `<-`, *kinda* similar to `=` in other languages). We also **commented** the steps using the hash symbol **\#**, so that we can write things to help us remember / explain the steps.


### If / Else

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x <- rnorm(n=1)

if( x > 0.5 ){
  print("Yes!")
} else{
  print("No :(")
}
```

Note that the **condition** (here `x > 0.5`) must be place between round brackets, whereas the code chunks for the ifs and elses are between curly brackets `{}`. This "grammar" is important for R to understand what you want to do.


## Functions

Similarly to the majority of programming languages, one can define ***functions*** in R. These are like little factories that take some input, do something, and then return some output. 

### Simple Function

A function can be defined like this:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
f <- function(x){
  x + 1
}

f(3)
```

We named that function `f()`, but we could have written anything (as long as there is no spaces), such as `my_new_function()`. Then, there is a **place-holder** for the input, that we named *x* (again, it could have been named anything). The last **very** important thing to know is that what is returned by the function is the *last object* in the function, in this case `x + 1`. 

So based on that, you understand that the function we defined above is equivalent to this one:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
my_function <- function(first_argument){
  output <- first_argument + 1  # Make addition
  output  # Return the stuff
}

my_function(3)
```

Notice the last line of the function, which just contains the final object we want to return (named "output"). Finally, adding **comments** is super useful to explain and remember what each step does.



### Multiple Arguments

A function often has multiple **arguments** (the "input" variables). This is used because a function is like a bubble, inside it (aka in the *local scope*) there is no knowledge out the "outside world" (called the *global scope*). So anything we want to know "from the outside" (for instance, things with which a user can interact) must be entered as arguments.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
f2 <- function(a, b, should_we_add){
  y <- a * b
  if(should_we_add == TRUE){
    z <- y + 3
  } else{
    z <- y - 3
  }
  z
}

f2(2, 3, TRUE)
```

Here, the user must specify values for `a`, `b` and `should_we_add`. We added a **conditional statement** inside the function, so that different things are done if one of the argument (`should_we_add`) has a certain value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).

However, most of the functions in R have **default arguments**, i.e., values associated to the arguments, that are changed **only if the users specifies otherwise**. So the function above could be written as follows:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
f2 <- function(a=2, b=3, should_we_add=TRUE){
  y <- a * b
  if(should_we_add == TRUE){
    z <- y + 3
  } else{
    z <- y - 3
  }
  z
}

f2()
```

The only difference is that in the **function definition** (the round brackets in which we write the arguments), each argument has some default value. That means that if the user don't manually specifies the argument, it will use the default ones. That's why the output of `f2()` (without anything) is the same as `f2(2, 3, TRUE)` 



## Methods

Have you ever wonder how it's possible that the **same functions**, for example `summary()`, can be applied to all kinds of different objects? And give different outputs? It's because they are not functions... *tumtumtum* but **methods**.

You can see methods as functions that only run **if the first argument is of a particular class**. What is a **class**, you might wonder? Let's see.

### Attributes

In a nutshell, in R, things are not what they look like. This means that objects are often more that "what is shown" (we'll come back to the what-is-shown later). Let's load the `iris` dataset for example and examine it. It is a **dataframe**, which gets displayed as follows:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- iris
data
```

This object has information attached to it, which is not displayed. This "additional" information is stored as **attributes**, which be retrieved as follows:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
attributes(data)
```

These attributes take the form of a **list** with elements, like column names, row names and... a **class** name. In R, the class of an object corresponds to what is written as a **class** attribute. We can retrieve it directly by running the `class()` function.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
class(data)
```

We could modify this class attribute, and let's see what happens:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
class(data) <- "new_class"
data
```

It gets displayed all weirdly! This is because "displaying" an object in R... actually runs a method. But we'll come back to that. For now, let us remember that we don't usually **replace** the class, simply add (**append**) a new one to the list, like `c("new_class", other_classes)`. That's because objects can have any number of classes.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
class(data) <- c("new_class", class(iris))
data
```

Now, it gets displayed correctly again, because it is also a dataframe (as well as an object of class *'new_class'*).

### Define objects with classes

Let's assemble everything we know and create objects with different classes:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
f_a <- function(x){
  output <- x * 2
  class(output) <- c("class_a", class(output))
  output  
}
f_a(3)


f_b <- function(x){
  output <- x * 3
  class(output) <- c("class_b", class(output))
  output
}
f_b(3)
```

Although having one different class, both objects remain of the 'numeric' class. This means that any method that works for 'numeric' will work for these objects, such as the square root:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sqrt(f_b(3))
```


### Defining Methods

Methods are pretty much defined like functions, with a twist. First, the name of the method must be added as a method using the `UseMethod()` function, which will tell R that this is a method.

Then, the methods are defined using the `name_of_method.name_of_class` pattern. You write the name of the class after a dot following the name of the method. This tells R **which function to use** depending on the class of the first argument.

A method for our two classes is defined as follows:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
new_method <- function(x){
  UseMethod("new_method")
}

new_method.class_a <- function(x){
  text <- "This is an object of class A"
  text
}

new_method.class_b <- function(x){
  text <- "This is an object of class B"
  text
}
```


We can now run `new_method()` on our two functions and see if it does something different.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
new_method(f_a(3))
new_method(f_b(3))
```

And that's about it. That's how the R ecosystem is made! Some packages define mostly new classes, like statistical models and such, and other packages (like **easystats** or **broom**) provide new methods to interact with these objects.
