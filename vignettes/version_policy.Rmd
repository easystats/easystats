R evolves every year. Each update brings many bug fixes and performance 
improvements, but also sometimes changes the default value of some parameters
(such as switching from `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` to `FALSE` in R 4.0.0).

While there is benefit in supporting older R versions, doing so adds some 
maintenance burden, especially in a large ecosystem like **easystats** that
contains 10 packages. Therefore, **easystats** is supported (meaning
thoroughly tested) on the latest R version, the future one (R-devel) and the
previous 4 versions. This corresponds to the [version policy of the
`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/04/r-version-support/).

Supposing R updates keep happening once a year in Spring, this table shows the 
corresponding latest R version and the oldest supported version:

| Year | Latest R version | Oldest R supported version |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 2024 | 4.4            | 4.0                      |
| 2025 | 4.5            | 4.1                      |
| 2026 | 4.6            | 4.2                      |
| 2027 | 4.7            | 4.3                      |
| 2028 | 4.8            | 4.4                      |

## Implications

The implications are simple:

* if you are a user and your R version is below the oldest supported one, you
  must update it to use the **easystats** packages;

* if you are a developer and your package depends on one of the **easystats**
  packages, the oldest version that your package supports corresponds to the 
  oldest version supported by **easystats**.
