# Reports citations for easystats publications

This function reports the total number of Google Scholar citations for
`easystats` publications through the `scholar` package.

## Usage

``` r
easystats_citations(sort_by = "year", length = 30)
```

## Arguments

- sort_by:

  Name of the column that should be used for sorting. Can be `"title"`,
  `"journal"`, `"year"`, or `"cites"`. Use `NULL` for no sorting and to
  return data as retrieved by Google scholar.

- length:

  Numeric, maximum length of the returned string. If not `NULL`, will
  shorten the string to a maximum `length`, however, it will not
  truncate inside words. I.e. if the string length happens to be inside
  a word, this word is removed from the returned string, so the returned
  string has a *maximum* length of `length`, but might be shorter.

## Value

A data frame of four columns: title, journal, year, and cites.

## Examples

``` r
# \dontrun{
easystats_citations()
#> Warning: Cannot connect to Google Scholar. Is the ID you provided correct?
