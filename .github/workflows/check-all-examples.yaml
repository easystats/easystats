# Make sure all examples run successfully, even the ones that are not supposed
# to be run or tested on CRAN machines by default.
#
# The examples that fail should use
#  - `if (FALSE) { ... }` (if example is included only for illustrative purposes)
#  - `try({ ... })` (if the intent is to show the error)
#
# This workflow helps find such failing examples that need to be modified.
