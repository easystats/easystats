Description: The 'easystats' package is a meta-package that contains a set of
    packages, all of which provide a unifying and consistent framework for 
    statistical modeling, visualization, and reporting. This package installs 
    and loads multiple 'easystats' packages in a single step. Additionally, 
    it provides articles targeted at instructors for teaching 'easystats',
    and a dashboard targeted at new R users for easily conducting statistical analysis 
    by accessing summary results, model fit indices, and visualizations.
