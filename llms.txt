# *easystats*: An R Framework for Easy Statistical Modeling, Visualization, and Reporting

## What is *easystats*?

*easystats* is a collection of R packages, which aims to provide a
unifying and consistent framework to tame, discipline, and harness the
scary R statistics and their pesky models.

However, there is not (yet) an *unique* “easystats” way of doing data
analysis. Instead, start with one package and, when you’ll face a new
challenge, do check if there is an *easystats* answer for it in other
packages. You will slowly uncover how using them together facilitates
your life. And, who knows, you might even end up using them all.

## Statement of Need

R is a powerful language for statistical computing, but its capabilities
are scattered across a fragmented landscape of packages. Conducting a
full analysis consisting of data manipulation, modeling, diagnostics,
interpretation, and visualization, often requires juggling multiple
tools with different syntax, design principles, outputs, and classes.
This creates barriers for newcomers and inefficiencies even for
experienced users.

The **easystats** ecosystem addresses this challenge by enabling a
seamless workflow from data exploration to result communication, while
nudging users toward good, reproducible and transparent statistical
practices with sensible defaults and clear documentation. The packages
in this ecosystem share consistent syntax and integrate seamlessly,
making robust analysis more accessible while reducing cognitive load for
novice and experienced R users alike.

The modular and lightweight nature of the **easystats** ecosystem
enables developers to use and integrate in other packages only the
necessary components. For example,
[insight](https://easystats.github.io/insight/), a dependency-free
package for retrieving model information, is utilized by 45 other CRAN
packages, such as [marginaleffects](https://marginaleffects.com/) and
[gtsummary](https://github.com/ddsjoberg/gtsummary). In contrast, the
[easystats](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/) meta-package
provides users with a cohesive experience, granting access to the entire
ecosystem and its consistent design principles without needing to know
the specific package of each function.

simply run the following:

## Getting started

Each *easystats* package has a different scope and purpose. This means
your **best way to start** is to explore and pick the one(s) that you
feel might be useful to you. However, as they are built with a “bigger
picture” in mind, you will realize that using more of them creates a
smooth workflow, as these packages are meant to work together. Ideally,
these packages work in unison to cover all aspects of statistical
analysis and data visualization.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How is *easystats* different from the *tidyverse*?**

You’ve probably already heard about the
[**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), another very popular
collection of packages (*ggplot*, *dplyr*, *tidyr*, …) that also makes
using R easier. So, should you pick the *tidyverse* or *easystats*?
**Pick both!**

Indeed, these two ecosystems have been designed with very different
goals in mind. The *tidyverse* packages are primarily made to create a
new R experience, where data manipulation and exploration is intuitive
and consistent. On the other hand, **easystats** focuses more on the
final stretch of the analysis: understanding and interpreting your
results and reporting them in a manuscript or a report, while following
best practices. You can definitely use the *easystats* functions in a
*tidyverse* workflow!

> **easystats + tidyverse =** ❤️

**Can *easystats* be useful to advanced users and/or developers?**

Yes, definitely! **easystats** is built in terms of modules that are
general enough to be used inside other packages. For instance, the
*insight* package is made to easily implement support for
post-processing of pretty much all regression model packages under the
sun. We use it in all the *easystats* packages, but it is also used in
other non-easystats packages, such as
[**ggstatsplot**](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot),
[**modelsummary**](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary/),
[**ggeffects**](https://github.com/strengejacke/ggeffects), and more.

**So why not in yours**?

Moreover, the *easystats* packages are very lightweight, with a minimal
set of dependencies, which again makes it great if you want to rely on
them.

**What are all the packages for? I’m lost!**

Statistical models are **scary monsters**, and *easystats* is the best
solution for expert and amateur stats hunters.

- **insight** contains the arsenal to capture them and dissect them. It
  is mostly meant to be used by experts who want to create their own
  tools.
- **performance** can be used to assess their scariness and value.
- **effectsize** is great to quantify and interpret their dangerousness
  (e.g., by how much variance they eat).
- **parameters** is useful to understand them by measuring their claws
  and taming them.
- **modelbased** allows you to unleash their power and use them at your
  service.
- **datawizard** contains useful potions and hunter equipment to survive
  in the stats jungle.
- **bayestestR** contains specific arrows and traps for a particular
  species of monsters (the monstrous Bayesians)
- **see** allows you to see clearer.

However, *easystats* can be used as a whole, by simply loading
[`library(easystats)`](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/) and using
the functions from various packages without caring where they belong.

## Documentation

### Websites

Each `easystats` package has a dedicated website.

For example, website for `parameters` is
<https://easystats.github.io/parameters/>.

### Blog

In addition to the websites containing documentation for these packages,
you can also read posts from `easystats` blog:
<https://easystats.github.io/blog/posts/>.

### Other learning resources

In addition to these websites and blog posts, you can also check out the
following presentations and talks to learn more about this ecosystem:

<https://easystats.github.io/easystats/articles/resources.html>

## Dependencies

*easystats* packages are designed to be lightweight, *i.e.*, they don’t
have any third-party hard dependencies, other than base-R packages or
other *easystats* packages! If you develop R packages, this means that
you can safely use *easystats* packages as dependencies in your own
packages, without the risk of entering the [dependency
hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

``` r

library(deepdep)

plot_dependencies("easystats", depth = 2L, show_stamp = FALSE)
```

![](reference/figures/depnetwork-1.png)

As we can see, the only exception is the
[`{see}`](https://easystats.github.io/see/) package, which is
responsible for plotting and creating figures and relies on
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), which does have a substantial
number of dependencies.
