# Summary

The **easystats** project is a collection of R packages that provides a unified and intuitive framework for statistical analysis. The ecosystem is built around a "tidyverse-like" philosophy of consistency, user-friendliness, and interoperability between packages. It aims to simplify the process of preparing, conducting, interpreting, and reporting statistical analyses by offering tools for a wide range of common tasks. These tasks include, for instance, data wrangling (`{datawizard}`), model assessment (`{performance}`), understanding and describing model parameters (`{parameters}`), computation of effect sizes [`{effectsize}`, @Ben-Shachar2020], calculating and visualizing marginal effects (`{modelbased}`), and generating publication-ready figures or reports of statistical models (`{see}` and `{report}`). The easystats ecosystem is designed to be accessible to both novice and experienced R users, promoting reproducible research and a more seamless workflow from data exploration to result communication.

# Statement of Need

The primary goal of easystats is to make statistical analysis in R more accessible and user-friendly for both novice and experienced users. It addresses the challenge of the often complex and fragmented landscape of statistical tools in R by offering a set of lightweight and interoperable packages. The modular design of easystats allows users to select and use only the packages they need, covering a wide range of common statistical tasks. The easystats packages are designed to be not only easy to use but also to be integrated into other packages, thus fostering a more collaborative and extensible statistical environment in R.
